# Flappy_Bird


I have designed and developed a fully operational web-based game with interactive features, drawing inspiration from the popular game Flappy Bird. The logic of the game was implemented using vanilla JavaScript, while advanced CSS techniques, such as keyframes, were employed to animate the moving components. The user interface was meticulously crafted to be visually pleasing and highly responsive, providing a seamless gaming experience on both mobile web browsers and desktop devices. To further engage users, I incorporated score tracking functionality, which significantly enhances user engagement and fosters a sense of competitiveness within the game. Players can now enjoy a captivating and challenging gaming experience while keeping track of their progress.
